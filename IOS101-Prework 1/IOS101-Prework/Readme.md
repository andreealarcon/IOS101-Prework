An app Iâ€™d love to build is Grass, a fun and rewarding way to get outside do outdoor activities to make money, while 
keeping your phone untouched. Users sign up, choose from tasks like playing frisbee in a park, birdwatching, exploring trails, or even 
gardening, and then get moving! The app uses motion sensors and GPS to confirm you're outdoors, and if you pick up your phone during the
activity, the timer resets. Completing activities earns you points, which can be redeemed for cash, gift cards, or discounts. You can also take 
part in community challenges like "Walk 1 mile today" to earn extra rewards. Grass turns being outside into a fun,  productive, and rewarding 
experience, all while helping you stay off your phone.
